This is primarily a short video platform where any user can post a challenge for other users to participate. Participations can then be upvoted by users to decide winners with the highest amount of upvotes.

## Highlights of the website include:
- built using the cutting edge **SvelteKit** framework
- The frontend uses **Tailwind** for styling
- Frontend code is written in SvelteJS with **TypeScript** support
- It is a server rendered app (SSR) that is hosted on infinitely horizontally scalable stateless **Docker** containers running on Google **Cloud Run**
- The API layer uses **SvelteKit Endpoints** to expose REST endpoints. Since the same project hosts both frontend and backend, they are on the same domain and hence no CORS worries
- These REST endpoints talk to a **PostgreSQL** database hosted on Google **Cloud SQL** via **Prisma** which acts as our data access layer.
- We also use Google **Cloud Tasks** for asynchronously processing delayed jobs
- We integrate with **Google Login** and **Facebook Login** using **Firebase Authentication**
- All uploaded videos are hosted and processed on **Cloudflare Stream**
- All requests to the app are routed through **Cloudflare**
